# custom-pseudocode-sublime

Sublime settings for Pseudocode ( the syntax highlighting on this sublime setting does not have any standard it just what seems good to me, and i have made this similar to js and even used some js styling in this highlighter ) 

original repo: [pseudocode-sublime](https://github.com/mattva01/pseudocode-sublime)

## Requirements

* Sublime Text 3

## Installation

### Via Git

1. In the sublime packages directory run

```text
git clone https://github.com/onixldlc/custom-pseudocode-sublime/ Pseudocode
```

### Manual

1. Download the zip from: <https://github.com/mattva01/pseudocode-sublime/archive/master.zip>
2. Extract the contents and rename the folder "Pseudocode"
3. Put this folder in your sublime packages directory (You can find it by going to Preferences > Browse Packages

## Usage

You can either select the Pseudocode from the language list or named a file with extension .pseudocode or .Pseudocode. and also feel free to report any issues since im sure there will be alot of edge cases that i have not seen with regex

and also... i dont think i will set this up on the package control since i think any one who need to use this would like to change some stuff before using it becs the syntax highlighting does not met any pseudocode standard, its just what i like to see when im working with pseudocode
